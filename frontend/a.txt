I've created a simple to medium complexity food ordering app using React with JavaScript. Here's what the app includes:


npm run dev



Key Features:
Menu Page: Displays food items with categories, images, descriptions, and prices
Shopping Cart: Add/remove items, adjust quantities, and see order summary
Checkout Process: Form for delivery details and payment method
Order Confirmation: Shows order details after successful checkout
App Structure:
Context API: Used for state management (cart items, quantities, totals)
React Router: For navigation between different pages
Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
Components:
Header: Navigation bar with logo and cart icon (shows item count)
Menu: Displays food items with filtering by category
Cart: Shows selected items with quantity controls and order summary
Checkout: Form for customer and delivery information
OrderConfirmation: Success page after placing an order
The app uses sample food data with images from Unsplash. You can browse the menu, add items to your cart, proceed to checkout, and place an order to see the full flow of the application.

The development server is now running, and you can interact with the application.









I've updated the food ordering app to focus on healthy dishes with the following changes:

App Name and Branding
Renamed the app to "NutriMeal" with a focus on healthy food
Changed the color scheme to green to represent health and freshness
Updated the menu items to focus on healthy vegetable and protein dishes
New Login System
Added a login page where users must authenticate before accessing the menu
Created an AuthContext to manage user authentication state
Protected all routes to ensure only logged-in users can access them
Added a logout button in the header
Menu Updates
Updated the menu data with healthy food options including:
Protein dishes (grilled chicken, salmon)
Vegetarian options (tofu stir fry, vegetable curry)
Breakfast items (overnight oats, egg white omelette)
Healthy drinks (green smoothie, protein shake)
Currency Change
Changed all prices to Indian Rupees (â‚¹)
Updated the tax rate to 5%
Payment Options
Added Indian payment methods including UPI
Included credit/debit card and cash on delivery options
The app now has a complete flow:

Users log in (any email/password will work for demo purposes)
Browse the healthy food menu and filter by category
Add items to cart and adjust quantities
Proceed to checkout with delivery and payment details
Receive order confirmation
The UI has been redesigned with a clean, health-focused aesthetic that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
